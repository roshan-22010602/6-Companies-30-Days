Magical String problem 
https://leetcode.com/problems/magical-string/description/

CODE:
In this problem, a magical string of 1 and 2 was provided, and we were supposed to count the number of times '1' occured in the string,
for a given length of string. I have initiated the string with '122' and then I have implemented a while loop to generate the string upto
the length given by the user. After that I have used the index operator and the bitwise operator in order to create the string which follows the 
magical string rule.

class Solution {
public:
    int magicalString(int n) {
        string magicstring="122";
        int index=2;
        while(magicstring.size()<n){
            int repeat=magicstring[index]-'0';
            char nextChar=magicstring.back()^3;
            magicstring+= string(repeat,nextChar);
            index++;
        }
        return count(magicstring.begin(),magicstring.begin()+n,'1');
       
    }
};
